# fazar
the mr.html is the page where users use to generate movies and it has its own css file which is mr.css
index.html is the home page 
the "get started" button in the home page   for now is used to redirect users to the mr.html page, but in future i would like that button to redirect users to sign up and login page 
the "try now" Button will be used to redirect users that don't want an account with fazar to the mr.html page 
and the navabar  we will figure out if we should add all those pages or add them later as updates in the future 
all the JavaScript for both the mr.html and index.html are in one place which js script.js
that result.html page might not be useful to us again , we can't delete it , because we might need it 
so with everything i have stated, we can now find an api for the job and do other necessary things 
thanks once again for joining me
